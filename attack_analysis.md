 

Attack Analysis: Using Elastic

This attack analysis is part of a Detection Engineering project using Elastic Security. The attack simulation involves hosting a Python web server using PowerShell on a target machine.

Tools used:
Target Machine - Windows 11 machine
Attacker Machine - Parrot OS
Tool used by attacker - Nmap, Nikto and ZAP
Log analysis tool - Elastic and Zeek

Steps for simulating and analysing the attack:

Step 1: Start Zeek in ubuntu machine.
Ensure it should be running.
Refer to ![zeekcontrol.png](./screenshots/zeekcontrol.png)

Step 2 : On the Windows 11 machine, Open Powershell and run the below command to run the web server
> python -m http.server

This will give all the active and running ports
Refer to ![server_running.png](./screenshots/server_running.png)

Step 3: Create a test file in a PowerShell window(another window)
> echo "test file" > *filename*
> cat *filename*
Refer to ![test_file.png](./screenshots/test_file.png)

Step 4: Access the Web server from Parrot OS
In Parrot OS, open a browser and navigate to the Windows 11 machineâ€™s IP address with the specified port.
This will display the "Directory listings." Refer to ![directory_listings.png](./screenshots/directory_listings.png)

Logs will also be shown in the PowerShell window where the server is running.
Refer to ![win11_powershelllogs.png](./screenshots/win11_powershelllogs.png)

Step 5: In Elastic, with Zeek running, use the following query in Discover:
event.dataset:zeek.http 
The PowerShell logs will appear. We can customize the columns and view the additional details.

Step 6: Run Nmap from Parrot OS
> sudo nmap -sV -p *port_number* *target ip*
Refer to ![nmap.png](./screenshots/nmap.png)

Step 7: Run Nikto from Parrot OS
> sudo nikto -h *target ip:port_number*
Refer to ![nikto.png](./screenshots/nikto.png)

Step 8: Perform OWASP-ZAP Scan
In Parrot OS, go to Applications -> Pentesting Tools -> Most Used Tools -> OWASP-ZAP
In OWASP-ZAP, Quick Start -> Automated scan -> Enter the url -> Attack -> See the logs
Refer to ![OWASP_ZAP.png](./screenshots/OWASP_ZAP.png)
Check various modules shown below.

Logs can also be viewed in the PowerShell window on the Windows 11 machine. 
Refer to ![zap_logs_win11.png](./screenshots/zap_logs_win11.png)

Alert creation in Elastic:

In Discover, use the following query to see logs related to Nmap, Nikto, and OWASP-ZAP activities:
"event.dataset:zeek.http"
See all the logs about the nmap, nikto, OWASP scanner and all the activities.

Rule creation:

1. To generate alerts for both Nmap and Nikto activity:
Refer to ![new_rule.png](./screenshots/new_rule.png)

2. Go to Security -> Alerts -> Rules -> Create new Rules
3. Choose Custom query 
Below is the query
event.dataset:zeek.http and user_agent.original:*Nmap* or user_agent.original:*Nikto*
Refer to ![new_rule_creation.png](./screenshots/new_rule_creation.png)

4. Add Suppress alerts by destination address
5. Provide Name and description
Refer to ![new_rule_creation.png](./screenshots/new_rule_creation.png)

6. In Advanced Settings, add relevant Mitre Att&ck tactic and technique
Refer to ![Mitre_info.png](./screenshots/Mitre_info.png)

7. Schedule run for 5 mins and create Alert.

Viewing Alerts:

Once the attack is simulated, check for the generated alerts by applying relevant filters. 
Refer to ![filtered_alerts.png](./screenshots/filtered_alerts.png)
I have filtered the logs, exported the rule, and added it to the repository.
